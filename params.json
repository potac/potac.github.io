{"name":"POTAC","tagline":"Programming of the Art Computer","body":"POTAC (pronounced poe-tack) is a workshop on the design of programming languages for the arts. Artists and musicians who write programs to generate their work place particular design pressures on their languages, for example having different relationships with time, commitment and error. This leads to the possibility of finding interesting new programming notations and languages that suit artists better than general programming languages.\r\n\r\nPlease note this is about design of programming languages rather than with programming languages. POTAC is not intended for general interface design or generative/computer arts discussion, although the line is likely to get blurry at times.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
